Contributing
------------

Feedback, bug reports, and pull requests are greatly appreciated :)

### Issues

The following are all great reasons to submit an issue:

1. You found a bug in the code.
2. Something is missing from the documentation or the existing documentation is unclear.
3. You have an idea for a new feature.

If you are thinking about submitting an issue please remember to:

1. Describe the issue in detail.
2. If applicable, describe the steps to reproduce the error, which probably should include some example code.
3. Mention details about your platform: OS, version of Go and Redis, etc.

### Pull Requests

Jobs uses semantic versioning and the [git branching model described here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
If you plan on submitting a pull request, you should:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new "feature branch" off of **develop** (not master) with a descriptive name (e.g. fix-database-error).
3. Make your changes in the feature branch.
4. Run the tests to make sure that they still pass. Updated the tests if needed.
5. Submit a pull request to merge your feature branch into the **develop** branch. Please do not request to merge directly into master.
